# doppelganger-project

### Overview

Inspired by the big doppelganger craze on social media a view years back, this project allows the user to upload their own personal image into my web app to find out their celebrity lookalike.

This project uses deep learning models to perform facial recognition on each image and measure facial features using OpenCV/dlib libraries.  This creates 128 different "measurements" of each image, and 

Then your inputted image gets compared to a dataset consisting of over 200k labeled celebrity images to find the closest match.
